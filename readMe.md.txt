
# we need to maintain person -> person_database
# there are many persons that can be concate -> person_database
# after verify person we can concate person -> person_database
# let focus on looping [create] a person process
# test and maintain the create loop  - verify it go back and further in create person section of the program
# now we loop the entire menu so we can see person_database inside [create], and [read] menu options from main menu
# loop statement above the menu options
# now I can create a person and see it in person_database from the read menu option
# created 17 persons from [main menu] > [create]menu > [auto]create person
# and displayable in both create and read.....
# you could improve via third level in the loop - its has currenly outloop( maintain person_database) and innerloop(create person) 
# remember to create string for -> database or string for concatenate person -> person_database
# add person database to person_database for Auto and also for normal create person option
# loop create person process
# loop all person process
# verify data is running per cycle , create stores and read displays
